# Line Following Car Project

Welcome to the repository for my latest creation - the Line Following Car! ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

## What's Inside?

- `code.py`: This is where the magic happens... a work in progress!
- `3d_design.stl`: This is the blueprint for the car body.

## How to Use?

1. **Download** or **clone** this repository to your computer. 
2. **Upload** the `code.py` file to your microcontroller board (like an Arduino) and pray it doesn't crash.
3. **3D Print** the `3d_design.stl` file to bring the car to life. It might not be the sleekest car you've ever seen, but hey, beauty is subjective, right?
4. **Connect** all the necessary bits and bobs (sensors, motors, etc.) to your microcontroller. Warning: this might involve some creative wiring and a few swear words.
5. **Power Up** the car and set it loose on a track with a line to follow. Cross your fingers and hope for the best!

## Materials

Will be updated later.

## How Can We Make This Less Shitty?

So, yeah, this first attempt is a bit... erm, rough. But fear not! I am planning to do some improvements

### Machine Learning
Ah, the holy grail of modern technology! Imagine if the car could learn from its mistakes... or at least learn to avoid crashing into the same wall over and over again. With machine learning, the possibilities are endless (and slightly terrifying).


So, there you have it - the Line Following Car: Shitty First Draft Edition. It may not be perfect, but hey, Rome wasn't built in a day... and neither was a self-driving car! ðŸ¤– Let's embark on this journey of trial and error together, shall we?
